Belvo Frontend Code Challenge
Purpose
Evaluate general frontend development skills and capabilities.
Guidance
This code challenge allows you to get creative while displaying your technical skills along the
way. Although you can spend as little or as much time as you would like to complete it, it should
not take you more than one afternoon. Get as much completed as you can, with the focus on
functionality over design.
In a fictional world, we are branching into the music business and need a new website. This
website needs to display the top 100 albums in the US based on the iTunes / Apple music API.
What should the website include and be made of:
- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here. Feel free to get a bit more creative
and show us your API handling skills by using this instead.
- Create a basic 2-page framework with basic navigation
- One with the general list
- One where you can see each selected album’s information
- A clean modern look
- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
- Source code on Github or other platform where we can access the repository
- Cross browser support (or graceful degradation)
- Responsive design and implementation
- A good user experience
Expectations
● Use a JavaScript framework (Angular, React, Vue, etc.)
● Use SASS or LESS for custom CSS
● Use of flexfox or grid system for CSS
● Make use of CSS animations
● Bonus points will be given for any of the following:
○ Allow the top 100 to be searchable
○ Host the website on the service of your choice (we enjoy cloud hosting like AWS,
but we would also settle for a *.github.io address)
● Double bonus points will be given for any of the following:
○ Use a language that compiles to JavaScript (CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Dart, etc.)
○ Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (e.g. advanced
search, integration with another API, a "Favourite" functionality, etc.)
